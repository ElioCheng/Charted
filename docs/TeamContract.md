- We agree to meet at both classes every week in MC 2038.
- We will communicate via Discord using the set-up team server and check communications on there at least every two days (excluding weekends)
- We have agreed on the following team roles:
  * Darren — Technical Lead
  * Elio — Project Lead
  * Sukhsimran — UI Design
  * Alex - Backend Lead
- The team will resolve disagreements using a democratic vote and in the case of a tie, the respective team lead makes the final decision. Another team member may decide to challenge a decision but only by putting in effort on their own time to make a detailed pitch to convince a majority.
- When an official team meeting is called by two or more of the members, all group members will be fully engaged and no forms of trolling or joking around will be allowed.
